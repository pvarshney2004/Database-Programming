# Database-Programming
This repository contains **Database Programming concepts implemented using Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL)**. It focuses on practical SQL development, database design, query optimization, and core database operations using **SQL Server** and **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**.

The repo is structured branch-wise, where each branch covers a specific database concept with examples, queries, and practice implementations.

## 🌿 Branches Overview

- **DDL-commands** → Table creation, alteration, deletion, and schema management.  
- **DML-commands** → Data manipulation operations like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT.  
- **constraints** → Primary key, foreign key, unique, check, default constraints implementation.  
- **joins** → Inner, left, right, full joins with practical queries.  
- **indexing** → Clustered and non-clustered indexes, performance optimization basics.  
- **keys** → Primary, foreign, candidate, composite keys usage.  
- **sub-queries** → Nested queries, correlated subqueries, filtering techniques.  
- **functions** → User-defined functions (scalar & table-valued).  
- **stored-proc** → Stored procedures creation, parameters, execution.  
- **views** → Virtual tables, security abstraction, simplified queries.  
- **temp-tables** → Temporary tables, scope, and usage scenarios.
